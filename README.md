# SCADA Guard: Sovereign Digital Immune System 🛡️

**World’s first smart offline cybersecurity software.**

Built for the **India Innovates Hackathon**, SCADA Guard is a real-time, fully offline Operational Technology (OT) defense system. It uses dynamic instrumentation (Frida) and a Sovereign Small Language Model (SLM) to protect critical government infrastructure from zero-day malware and rogue insider attacks without relying on cloud APIs.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

This system operates on a **Neuro-Symbolic, Zero-Trust Bridge** model, divided into three defensive tiers:

1. **The Sensory Layer (Synchronous API Hooking):** Instead of asynchronous monitoring, the agent acts as an OS-level toll booth using Frida. It intercepts critical system calls (e.g., `WriteFile`, `CreateRemoteThread`) and physically pauses untrusted threads before execution.
2. **The Cognitive Layer (Sovereign SLM):** A 100% indigenous Micro-Transformer (~120K parameters) trained from scratch on SCADA telemetry and system calls. It analyzes behavioral intent in `<2ms` entirely on local CPU. 
3. **The Action Layer (Graceful Degradation):** The LLM never executes commands directly. A deterministic Python engine parses the AI's verdict and terminates malicious threads or drops compromised users into restricted VLANs.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python defender_core.py

## Quick Test

python scada_guard.py      # Test the local SLM classifier
python simulator.py        # Test file access and syscall simulation

## 🛠️ Configuration

1. Edit the core files directly to modify system parameters:

2. simulator.py: SCADA_ROOT path

3. defender_core.py: DEFAULT_PYTHON, LOG_DIR

4. hook.js: Modify the shouldSkip() function for Tier-1 process whitelisting/filtering.

## 🔌 API Usage

from scada_guard import classify_with_confidence

# Evaluates the behavioral intent of a system call sequence
verdict, conf = classify_with_confidence("WriteFile", r"C:\scada_database.txt", 1024, True)

# Returns: ("MALICIOUS", 0.95)

## 🧠 Retrain the Sovereign Model
If you want to train the Micro-Transformer from scratch on your own machine:

pip install -r ml/requirements_ml.txt
cd ml

python data_gen.py       # Generate synthetic SCADA training data
python tokeniser.py      # Build indigenous vocabulary
python train.py          # Train & export to ONNX format
python evaluate.py       # Test accuracy


Note: The newly trained model saves to ../scada_guard.onnx.

Model Specifications
Architecture: Custom Micro-transformer (2 layers, 4 heads, ~120K params)

Input: Tokenized file paths + 7 behavioral features

Output: BENIGN or MALICIOUS

Speed: <2ms/event on standard CPU (No GPU required for inference)

📦 Dependencies
Production Engine:

frida>=16.0.0

rich>=13.0.0 (For high-fidelity terminal UI)

onnxruntime>=1.18.0

Training Engine:

torch>=2.2.0
